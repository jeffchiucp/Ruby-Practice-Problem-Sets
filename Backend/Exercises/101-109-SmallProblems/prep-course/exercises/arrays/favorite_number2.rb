# In the code below, a nested array containing three groups of names and numbers is assigned to favorites.
# Use Array#flatten to flatten favorites so that it's no longer a nested array.
# Then assign the flattened array to a variable named flat_favorites and print its value using #p

favorites = [['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]]

# answer

flat_favorites = favorites.flatten
p flat_favorites # ["Dave", 7, "Miranda", 3, "Jason", 11]
